{"name":"pdxbyte","tagline":"Portland Byte","body":"# Welcome to pdxbyte.\r\nA Portland Oregon users group primarily for languages that compile to machine native format such as C, C++, and Assembly. \r\n\r\n# Meeting format\r\n* Beginner talk\r\n* Short break\r\n* Announcements\r\n* Intermediate to advanced talk\r\n\r\n### Beginner talk\r\nHello World!\r\nA lot of experienced programmers feel like beginners with C even if they used it in school if they haven't used it extensively since then. Students, and people who might need a refresher should both feel comfortable in this part of the meeting.\r\n\r\n### Announcements\r\nThe second part of the meeting will have a set start time such that people can skip the first talk. Announcements include telling people about projects they are looking to collaborate with, upcoming events, and \"We're Hiring\". \r\n\r\n### Intermediate to advanced talk\r\nCould be almost anything. Starting a new hobby operating system? Programming spin control on a rocket? Writing a fast paced 3d video game? Bootstrapping bare metal via a JTAG debugger? We'd love to hear about it. \r\n\r\n# Location and time\r\nThe location, and time of the first meeting isn't set yet, but there is a high probability that it will be hosted at New Relic as someone from there offered already.\r\n\r\n# Get in Touch\r\n[Join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/pdxbyte)\r\n\r\n# Code of conduct\r\nDon't be a jerk\r\n\r\n# Organizers\r\nDaniel Patrick Johnson (@teknotus) got things moving with a call for proposals on the DorkbotPDX mailing list, Thomas Lockney (@tlockney) thought of the name pdxbyte, and generously donated the domain names.\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\nThis page is hosted at github.
